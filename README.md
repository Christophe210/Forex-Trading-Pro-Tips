Trading gold against the USD (XAU / USD) :
..........................................

1. <strong>London Session (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM CAT):</strong> This session overlaps with the end of the trading day in Europe and the beginning of the trading day in New York. It often sees increased liquidity and volatility for gold. <br>

2. <strong>New York Session (3:00 PM - 11:00 PM CAT):</strong> This is when the New York Stock Exchange is open, and it's a significant period for trading gold against the USD due to the high volume of trades. <br>

3. <strong>Asian Session (11:00 PM - 7:00 AM CAT):</strong> While not directly in your local daytime, it can still be relevant if you're planning to trade during late evening or early morning hours. <br>

What Is Inverse Correlation (Gold vs USD)?

When two assets have an inverse correlation, it means:

When one goes up, the other usually goes down.


This is typically true for Gold (XAU) and the US Dollar (USD):

When USD strengthens, Gold tends to fall

When USD weakens, Gold tends to rise



---

Why Does This Happen?

1. Gold is priced in USD

Gold is traded globally in US Dollars

When the USD gets stronger, it takes fewer dollars to buy the same amount of gold â€“ so Gold prices usually fall

When the USD weakens, it takes more dollars to buy gold â€“ so Gold prices rise


2. Gold is a safe haven

When the world fears inflation, recession, or crisis, traders often sell USD and buy Gold as a safe store of value

If the US economy is strong and rates are high, investors buy USD for higher yields, and sell Gold



---

How to Use This in Trading

Step 1: Track USD Strength with the Dollar Index (DXY)

DXY measures the USD vs a basket of other major currencies

When DXY goes up, USD is stronger â†’ Gold may fall

When DXY goes down, USD is weaker â†’ Gold may rise


You can find DXY on most trading platforms like TradingView.

Step 2: Check the Fundamental News

Look at economic indicators that affect USD:

Interest Rate Hikes (Fed meetings)

Inflation Reports (CPI, PPI)

Employment Data (NFP)

Strong USD news = possible Gold drop

Weak USD news = possible Gold rise


Step 3: Use Technical Analysis to Confirm

Example setup:

DXY is falling â†’ USD weak

XAU/USD shows bullish pattern (e.g., double bottom, bullish engulfing)

Enter long trade on Gold with confirmation



---

Example in Action

Letâ€™s say:

US inflation report is worse than expected (USD likely weakens)

DXY drops from 106 to 104

Gold jumps from $2,000 to $2,050


Thatâ€™s an inverse move you can trade with good timing!
